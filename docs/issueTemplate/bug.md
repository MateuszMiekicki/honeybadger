# Proof-read before posting!

Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're
seeing it for the first time: does it make sense? Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make
sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it
again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!
